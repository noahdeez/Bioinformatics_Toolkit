# Bioinformatics Toolkit

The Bioinformatics Toolkit is a Python-based suite of tools designed to facilitate efficient and organized bioinformatics analyses using pandas, SQLite, and Jupyter notebooks.

## Features

- **Data Upload and Setup**: Load tabular CSV data, validate its integrity, and store it into a SQLite database with ease.
- **Interactive Interface**: Leverage the power of Jupyter notebooks to interactively handle and analyze bioinformatics data.
- **Extendability**: Built with modularity in mind, making it easy to integrate additional bioinformatics tools or libraries in the future.
